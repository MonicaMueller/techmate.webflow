      </ol>
      <h3>I. Additional Provisions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>You acknowledge and agree that the Service is provided to you with the following limited warranty: If the service you receive from a Techmate is not satisfactory based on a verifiable defect in the work product or the Techmate’s performance, and you inform Techmate of your dissatisfaction within 30 days after receipt of the service, Techmate will either arrange to have a Techmate&nbsp;address the issues to your reasonable satisfaction or refund the amount paid for the specific service that is the basis for the complaint. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, the Service and all Techmate work and work product generated thereunder is made available on an “AS IS” basis without any warranty whatsoever, and your sole and exclusive remedy, and Techmate’s sole obligation to you or any third party for any claim arising out of your use of the Service, is that you are free to discontinue your use of the Service at any time. Neither Techmate nor the Techmate makes any warranty whatsoever regarding the condition of your equipment, software, network or Internet connection, operating environment or other elements of your system, or whether or not it can be repaired or made to perform any particular function or meet any particular specification. “Service” includes only the conscientious application of the Techmate’s skills to evaluate and address a given customer problem and the making of recommendations for solutions, which may include substantially more expense (for equipment replacement, software upgrades, rewiring, etc.) than the Techmate’s quoted fee. Except as expressly set forth herein, Techmate expressly disclaims any implied warranties of any kind, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, and you agree that Techmate shall have no liability for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential (including lost profit), exemplary or punitive damages (even if Techmate has been advised of the possibility of such damages) arising out of the use of the Service or any consequences which flow from it. Some states and provinces do not allow limitations on or exclusion of incidental or consequential damages. In such states and provinces, the above exclusions may not apply to you.</li>
        <li>These terms will inure to the benefit of Techmate’s successors, assigns and licensees.</li>
        <li>If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, for any reason, by any court of competent jurisdiction that provision shall be modified in order to make it enforceable, while maintaining the spirit of the provision. Alternatively, if modification is not possible, such provision shall be stricken and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms.</li>
        <li>The failure of Techmate to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>
        <li>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Techmate services or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</li>
        <li>The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</li>
        <li>The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely in the State of Delaware and between Delaware residents. You agree to submit to jurisdiction in Delaware and that any claim arising under these Terms and Conditions will be brought solely in a court in Kent County, Delaware.</li>
        <li>Contacting Techmate. a) If you have any questions, concerns, feedback, etc. about the Service and/or the Terms (aside from a Copyright Complaint as addressed above), please feel free to contact us at Techmate T: 415-841-2745; E: <a href="mailto:support@jointechmate.com">support@jointechmate.com</a>
